    PINE (Pluralism in Economics) is a student-driven initiative at Maastricht
    University that wants to foster debate about pluralist economics and improve
    the economics curriculum in order to include a plurality of perspectives. We
    are working at University College Maastricht (UCM), a Liberal Arts College
    in the center of Maastricht.

  # Why Pluralism?


  In the 20th century, the economics discipline has become entrenched in a
  narrow mainstream version of the discipline, effectively eliminating all other
  perspectives on the central topics of economics.


  This development is regrettable in itself, because as a social science,
  pluralism (a diversity of views and perspectives) is essential for the
  discipline to thrive. However, the uniformity of economics has other, arguably
  even more important effects. Students and academics in the field are not
  sufficiently encouraged to be critical of the theories they learn and to
  question the underlying assumptions, and economic policy is guided by a social
  science that is not based on open, critical debate, but on the perpetuation of
  mainstream, quasi-dogmatic tenets and assumptions. Because of these reasons,
  societal and ecological challenges of the 21st century cannot be addressed
  appropriately.


  Pluralism in economics entails firstly that the many different existing
  branches receive attention and consideration, and secondly that economics is
  more closely linked to other related disciplines such as philosophy, history,
  sociology, psychology and political science.


  # Other Initiatives on Pluralism


  ## ISIPE


  In 2013, the International Student Initiative for Pluralism in Economics
  (ISIPE) published an open letter to call for more pluralistic approaches in
  the teaching of economics. Different student groups from all across the world
  associate with them to shout for a global change in the economics curriculum.


  Check out their open letter and associated groups
  [here](http://www.isipe.net/open-letter/)!


  ## Plurale Ökonomik


  Plurale Ökonomik is the German network for pluralism in economics. Their two
  aims relate to the information of students, teachers or professors and anyone
  interested in the topic of economic theory and the action to implement more
  plural teaching in German Universities. They are closely associated with ISIPE
  and Pluralowatch and offer a great amount of readers that are accessible for
  anyone.

  ## Rethinking Economics


  Rethinking Economics is an international network of students, academics and
  professionals building a better economics in society and the classroom.
  Through a mixture of campaigning, events and engaging projects, Rethinking
  Economics connects people globally to discuss and enact the change needed for
  the future of economics, and to propel the vital debate on what economics is
  today.

  ## Institute for New Economic Thinking


  The Institute for New Economic Thinking is dedicated to the rigorous pursuit
  of innovative economic theories and methods that address society’s most
  pressing concerns.

  ## Levy Economics Institute


  The Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, founded in 1986 through the
  generous support of Bard College trustee Leon Levy, is a nonprofit,
  nonpartisan, public policy research organization. The Levy Institute is
  independent of any political or other affiliation, and encourages diversity of
  opinion in the examination of economic policy issues while striving to
  transform ideological arguments into informed debate.
