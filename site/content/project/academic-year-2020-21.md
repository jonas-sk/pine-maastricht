Throughout the academic year 2020/2021 PINE organised a diverse selection of events including movie screenings, book clubs and guest lectures. While the online environment was sometimes challenging, it also gave us the opportunity to invite exciting international speakers and get in touch with other Rethinking Economics local groups. If you are interested in what we have done, scroll on and see some of the highlights!



# Thomas Piketty: 

During the autumn of 2020 PINE explored the work of French economist Thomas Piketty. His second book "Capital and Ideology" was newly published in English and we seized the opportunity to get to know his theories better. Subsequently, we organised two public events on either one of his books in order to make more students familiar with his work on economic inequality. 

## Movie Screening - "Capital in the 21st Century" 

On October 7th we organised an online movie screening of the documentary "Capital in the 21st century". The movie is based on Pickety's ground-breaking bestseller with the same name - a recommendable read for any pluralist! While the book was already released in 2013, the movie premiered only few months before. After the joint movie session via Zoom, a lively discussion between the attendees refelcting on the content and its implications developed.

Four weeks later welcomed Pieter Pekelharing from the University of Amsterdam to host a workshop on Piketty's new book "Capital and Ideology". At the start Piekelharing gave the partcipants a short recap of the book's content highlighting the major conclusions and. Afterwards guided and participated in a lively discussion with the attending students. The interactive format allowed all students to share their thoughts or ask questions. A successfull conclusion of the "Piketty-Autumn".
