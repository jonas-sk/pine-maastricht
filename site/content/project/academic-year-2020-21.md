Throughout the academic year 2020/2021 PINE organised a diverse selection of events including movie screenings, book clubs and guest lectures. While the online environment was sometimes challenging, it also gave us the opportunity to invite exciting international speakers and get in touch with other Rethinking Economics local groups. If you are interested in what we have done, scroll on and see some of the highlights!
