  A draft course outline for a pluralist economics course called "Economics and
  Society"
---
During the past year, we have worked hard to provide a first draft of a pluralistic economics course. We are now proud to present the course outline of "Economics and Society", which can be downloaded [here](/img/pine-economicssociety-draftoutline.pdf).
