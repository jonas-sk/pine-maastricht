    Can you imagine your economics professors or politicians questioning the
    value of economic growth? Reconsider the dominant theories of banking?
    Philosophize about the fundamental values we perpetuate with our economic
    activity? No? Well, that’s what we will do at this year’s PINE Conference
    ‘The Purpose of the Economy’. Let’s call into question the very basis of the
    economic conduct: What is its purpose, what do we do it for? Should we amend
    the purpose we are currently following?


    At our conference, you will get the chance to come together with fellow
    students, friends and experts to tackle these and more issues from a
    pluralistic perspective. It doesn’t matter whether you are studying
    economics or biology, philosophy or medicine; whether you are a carpenter or
    academic; whether you are just entering your adult life or getting ready for
    pension; this is the place for you! No pre-knowledge is required.
    Nonetheless: Complex issues require complex solutions, and it is up to us to
    draft and realize them. Join us this June in beautiful Maastricht!

  # Details


  The Pluralism in Economics Conference is an annual two-day event organised by
  the student initiative Pluralism in Economics (PINE) at the University College
  Maastricht (UCM). With its conferences, PINE wants to offer a platform for
  discussing the role of pluralism in economics to understand complex
  socio-economic issues in today’s societies as well as the broader value of
  pluralist economics education at university-level. Given that the University
  College Maastricht is located right at the centre of Europe, it provides an
  ideal location for bringing together motivated students from across Europe who
  are passionate about pluralist economics education.


  In the past years, our conferences have been successful in all imaginable
  respects and received positive feedback from participants, speakers, track and
  workshop facilitators, the university, partner organisations and the PINE-team
  itself. We hosted around a hundred enthusiastic and interested people, who
  joined us from all around the Netherlands and its surrounding countries to
  converse under headings such as ‘Capitalism & Democracy’ or ‘Capitalism &
  Inequality’. The setting, in this as in all previous years, is the building of
  University College Maastricht, a refurbished old monastery full of character
  and allure. As we understand it, the conference’s atmosphere is just as
  important as its content. Accordingly, in order to stimulate a relaxed and
  fruitful sense of vision and constructive debate, we supplement the scene with
  fringe events and decorations. Imagine a bright and colourful arrangement
  including a ‘Market of Inspiration’, a ‘Playground of Ideas’, multiple
  interaction possibilities, art installations, performances of the faculty’s
  circus committee, live music and of course an assortment of vegan and
  vegetarian foods and drinks.


  This year’s Pluralism in Economics Conference revolves around the question
  which purpose the economy serves and which purpose an economy should ideally
  serve in today’s societies. Traditionally, neoclassical theory defines the
  discipline of economics as the study of human behaviour under conditions of
  scarce resources with alternative uses to reach desired ends. While this
  definition sketches a broad frame of how human actors and material goods
  relate to each other, it does not take into account the more fundamental
  question which social ends ought to constitute the basis of an economy.
  Accordingly, we want to raise the fundamental question: Which purpose should
  an economy in today’s societies serve?


  In order to find answers to this question, participants will be granted the
  opportunity to choose between five different tracks ranging from the
  relationship between the state and economy to the role of democracy,
  distributive justice, growth and happiness within today’s economies. More
  specifically, guiding questions in defining the purpose of the economy will
  be: What could be the role of the state in a modern economy? Market vs.
  Democracy: who should decide on what? Which value does our economy create and
  how is it distributed? Does economic growth serve the purpose of the economy?
  And which role does the happiness of citizens play in conceptualising the
  purpose of the economy?


  Answering these questions demands interdisciplinary investigation which the
  PINE Conference 2019 will contribute to. Aligning with the idea of Pluralism
  in Economics, we will offer a platform for discussing the purpose that
  economies should serve in today’s societies from the perspectives of various
  disciplines, among them different branches of economic thought, politics,
  sociology and political philosophy. Together with experts and motivated
  students from various backgrounds, we will conceptualise the purpose of modern
  economies on theoretical grounds and connect our findings to contemporary case
  studies such as growing populist tendencies, political apathy, the role of
  financial crises and citizen’s happiness as well as income- and wealth
  disparities within today’s societies. Thus, our aim is to connect theory with
  praxis, experts with motivated students, work with leisure time and to act as
  a bridge among different disciplinary backgrounds.


  In this spirit, the purpose of this year’s Pluralism in Economics Conference
  is to sketch new narratives and imaginaries for conceptualising an economic
  system that incorporates variables which are deemed to serve the purpose of an
  economy and which transcend the limited definition of economics in
  neoclassical theory. Do you want to be part of this endeavour? Then join the
  Pluralism in Economics Conference “The Purpose of the Economy” in summer 2019
  at the University College Maastricht in the Netherlands!

      image: /img/about-jumbotron.jpg
      text: >-
        Thinking about the role of the state has until recently been an exercise
        in demonizing the state and politics in general. Welfare states have
        been under attack, liberties of individuals were highlighted and led to
        identity politics, lobbies and think tanks use their (intellectual)
        power to influence and shift public debate as well as public opinion.
        The corporate world is full of scandals, both in the real world – think
        about diesel engines – or in the financial world, where national
        governments were targeted by criminals that took billions from them.
        Global warming is not addressed by national government in any satisfying
        way, inequality of incomes and wealth is at maximum levels – it seems
        that the role of the State must be reinvented if current issues of today
        must be addressed effectively and without much delay. We will discuss
        what the State can do in policy fields like the Green New Deal,
        distribution policy, industrial policy, the Job Guarantee and financial
        market regulation. The track facilitator is Dr. Dirk Ehnts.
    - heading: What Kind of Pluralism in Economics?
      image: /img/about-direct-sourcing.jpg
      text: >-
        In this track we will explore the notion of pluralism in economics in
        some depth. We will look at different kinds of pluralism or dimensions
        in which it can be achieved. Then we will consider whether these kinds
        are all equally beneficial and, if so, to what extent. We will focus on
        the role of pluralism in economics with respect to two aspects:
        economics as a scientific discipline and decision-making in policy
        contexts. The track facilitator will be Melissa Vergara Fernández.
    - heading: 'Freedom, Efficiency and Justice in the Market '
      image: /img/about-reinvest-profits.jpg
      text: >-
        Freedom, Efficiency and Justice are three appealing values we might want
        our economic system to realise. However, it is not clear what it means
        to do so, and if they can all be realised at the same time. In this
        track we will consider how we might operationalise these three values
        and explore what trade-offs there are between them, as well as how they
        might be reconciled. The track facilitator will be Prof. Teun Dekker.
    - heading: The Purpose of the Economy - Growth?
      image: /img/about-sustainable-farming.jpg
      text: >-
        In this track we will focus on the role of economic growth and its
        entanglements with the purpose(s) of the economy. We trace how economic
        growth is argued to fulfil certain proclaimed purposes of the economy
        (such as stability, employment, or well-being), and subsequently
        investigate why certain scholars – especially ecological economists –
        demand a move away from economic growth, either meaning a move away from
        GDP as a welfare indicator, or referring to a radical move away from
        capitalist modes of production and consumption. We discuss a range of
        different variants of degrowth and post-growth positions, as well as
        critiques thereof. In the second half of the workshop we take a closer
        look at consequences of rejecting economic growth as a measure of
        societal welfare, and investigate how different models of welfare, which
        move away from environmentally harmful consumer welfare, might look
        like. The track facilitator will be Birte Strunck

      text: >-
        I am a philosopher of science, specialised in economics. I aspire to
        establish dialogues between philosophers and economists that can
        contribute to the reliability of economics as a science. I see economics
        as a social science. This implies that it contributes to social
        scientific knowledge but offers a single and limited perspective to this
        knowledge. I got my PhD at the Erasmus Institute for Philosophy and
        Economics, at Erasmus University Rotterdam. I am currently a Lecturer at
        the Faculty of Economics and Business, Department of Economics,
        Econometrics, and Finance at the University of Groningen. I also teach
        philosophy of the social sciences at University College Groningen.
