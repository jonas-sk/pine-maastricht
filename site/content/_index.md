    PINE (Pluralism in Economics) is a student-driven initiative at Maastricht
    University that wants to foster debate about pluralist economics and improve
    the economics curriculum in order to include a plurality of perspectives. We
    are working at University College Maastricht (UCM), a Liberal Arts College
    in the center of Maastricht.
