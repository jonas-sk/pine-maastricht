    PINE (Pluralism in Economics) is a student-driven initiative at Maastricht
    University that wants to foster debate about pluralist economics and improve
    the economics curriculum in order to include a plurality of perspectives. We
    are working at University College Maastricht (UCM), a Liberal Arts College
    in the center of Maastricht.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
