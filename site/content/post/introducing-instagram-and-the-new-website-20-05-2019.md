This new website was developed for the [PINE Conference 2019](https://pine-maastricht.nl/conference-2019/) and we migrated most content from the [old website](https://pinemaastricht.wordpress.com/). This new website has a number of advantages for us:

* It has its own domain, pine-maastricht.nl, instead of a Wordpress-subdomain.
* It offers a much clearer structure to readers with blog and project sections listing past activities chronologically.
* It is much more visual and has a cleaner design.
* It is responsive and works well on mobile devices.

As part of our outreach efforts for the conference, we also now have an Instagram account. You can follow us under [@pinemaastricht](https://www.instagram.com/pinemaastricht/)!

Introducing the new website and Instagram account, we hope to reach many more students and activists. If you have any questions, feel free to [reach out](https://pine-maastricht.nl/contact/) to us! You can also sign up to our conference [here](https://event.gg/12191/)!
